<p>You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/msrc">microsoft.com/msrc</a>.</p>
<p>Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)</li>
<li>Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue</li>
<li>The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)</li>
<li>Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue</li>
<li>Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue</li>
<li>Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)</li>
